# 98-interoperability
 A repository to discuss issues to S-98 Product Specification of IHO

 The 1.1 directory contains the working drafts for Edition 1.1, divided into separate directories for the "interoperability catalogue" and "Annex C".

 S-98 Edition 1.0.0 was published by the IHO in May 2022. Its various components, including Annex C, can be downloaded from the [IHO publications page](https://iho.int/en/standards-and-specifications). Schemas are available from the [schema server](https://schemas.s100dev.net) and [preview schema server](https://staging.s100dev.net) (the latter site contains previews).
