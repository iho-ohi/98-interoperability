# 98-interoperability
 A repository to discuss issues to S-98 Product Specification of IHO

 The documents folder contains a 1.1 directory which has the original Edition 1.1. of S-98. Other folders contain updated versions of S-90 Annex C, as a result of the review process within the group.

 S-98 Edition 1.0.0 was published by the IHO in May 2022. Its various components, including Annex C, can also be downloaded from the [IHO publications page](https://iho.int/en/standards-and-specifications).
 
 Schemas are available from the [schema server](https://schemas.s100dev.net) and [preview schema server](https://staging.s100dev.net) (the latter site contains previews).
