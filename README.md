# 98-interoperability
 A repository to discuss issues to S-98 Product Specification of IHO

 The documents folder contains a numbered directories which have the original Edition 1.1. of S-98. Other folders contain updated versions of S-90 Annex C, as a result of the review process within the group as well as the 2024 face to face meeting.

 S-98 Edition 1.0.0 was published by the IHO in May 2022. Its various components, including Annex C, can also be downloaded from the [IHO publications page](https://iho.int/en/standards-and-specifications).
 
 Schemas are available from the [schema server](https://schemas.s100dev.net) and [preview schema server](https://staging.s100dev.net) (the latter site contains previews).
 
 Edition 2.0.0 will be submitted to the IHO HSSC for approval in 2025. Draft versions are included (as works in progress) in this repository. The official versions will be hosted and distributed by the IHO when they are ready for working group review.
